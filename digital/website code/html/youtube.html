           <p1 class="valorantText"> When i got really bored one day i decided to make a youtube channel as i thougtht i would be a way of letting out my creative ideas, and so far it has been really fun being able to make a video and knowing it might cheer at least one person up its a really good feeling.  mainly make minecraft and occashionally CSGO videos. one of the mains reason i wanted to do this was so i could combind my two favourite things in one, my love for gaming and my love of making people laugh was a really easy mix to make especially when you dont have to think about it like me. This is what i want to do for a living and hopefully it works out. My Proudest video has to be the video displayed which is a montage of all my greatest moments playing minecraft. On youtube and the internet in gerneral i go by "Party Squid Ad" and have been for about 8 years now, however only started youtube in September 2021
